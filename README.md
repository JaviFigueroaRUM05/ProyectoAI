# ProyectoAI

This repository contains the source code for the final project of the Artificial Intelligence Course.
To run the A* algorithm just run the astar_implementation.py script.
To run the SDA* algorithm just run the sdastar_implementation.py script.

We recomend the use of the interactive notebooks that precede these scripts.
